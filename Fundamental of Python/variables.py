# Variables allow us to store value
# A variable has a vlaid name ( letter,underscore,digits, not a reserved keyword)
# Python is dynamically typed so variables can be re declared.
# We can use shortcut operator in order to cleanly redeclare a variable

number_of_tomato = 5
number_of_potato = 15

print("Total of Item" , number_of_potato + number_of_tomato)

# You can also redeclare value like 

number_of_potato = number_of_potato + 7
print (number_of_potato)

number_of_potato = 50
print(number_of_potato)

#  Shortcut variable lik

number_of_tomato += 1
print(number_of_tomato)
