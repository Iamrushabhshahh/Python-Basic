# ========================================= Summary ===================================================

# Let's understand the print
    # It's build in function - can be used without importing it.
    # Allows us to print values to the consol
    # We can invoke it with parenthesess
    # We can pass the value we want to print as arguments between the parentheses.
    # The backslash \ tells python that the next character has a special meaning ( eg. \n = new line character )
    #  Keyword argument such as a sep and end can be used to format the output.
